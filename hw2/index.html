<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this assignment, I learned how to implement splines, curves, and meshes in order to create smooth objects. Additionally,
  I implemented Phong shading in order to better represent smooth surfaces. Finally, I learned how to manipulate meshes, to make 
  them more fine or rounded through loop subdivision, splitting and flipping edges.

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  Casteljau's algorithm is a way of approximating a curve from many connected, potentially jagged line segments. This allows
  for smooth lines and transitions when rendering images. By evaluating one point at a time along different parts of each line segment,
  we can extrapolate a smooth curve. To evaluate the Bezier curve, I start with the original control points. For each pair of 
  consecutive control points, I calculate a new point by interpolating between them based on a parameter 't' ranging from 0 to 1.
  Then, I replace the original control points with my newly calculated points, and repeat until I only have one point left. By doing
  the same process with different values of t (starting at 0 and change with a limit approaching infinity), I can obtain a curve 
  by connecting my calculated points.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    The evaluation step between Bezier curves and Bezier surfaces are evaluated exactly the same, except 3D surfaces store 3D vectors
    instead of 2D ones. The main difference lies in the amount of calculations that you have to do. For a 3D surface, we must evaluate
    De Casteljau's algorithm independently in 2 dimensions instead of just 1. When starting with control points, first calculate all 
    the Bezier curves in 1 dimension (say the rows). Using the new points from the first dimension, we are able to calculate De Casteljau's 
    algorithm in the other dimension, the columns. Repeat the De Casteljau's algorithm calculations until we are left with a single point 
    in the Bezier surface.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    Like mentioned in the comment, I implemented area-weighted vertex normals by taking the area-weighted average of the normals of 
    neighboring triangles, then normalizing. Specifically, I first looped through all the faces of the triangles connected to the 
    current vertex, taking note of their 3 vertices (the current vertex, and 2 other ones). I then took the cross product of two 
    vectors along the face, which is the neighboring face/triangle's normal. I summed these values up, and tehn normalized by taking 
    the final unit vector of the sum.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    To think of edge flipping without creating/deleting existing edges, I imagined the pair of triangles connected to the given edge were 
    turned 90 degrees on its side. I began by clearly labeling all the halfedges, vertices, faces, and edges. Essentially, the most 
    important flips were rotating the vertices and outer halfedges (those connected to the outer faces), and updating all of their pointers. 
    Keeping this in mind, I relabeled all the other halfedges accoring to the flip, and assigned them all 1-by-1 using setNeighbors(). I 
    made sure all the vertices, edges, and faces were then reassigned based on my new drawing. Additionally, I added a check at the 
    beginning of the function so that we do not flip boundary edges!

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    After initally assigning values to all existing halfedges, vertices, faces, and edges, I create all the new elements I need to perform an 
    edge split: 1 new vertex, 2 new faces, 3 new edges, and 6 new halfedges. I set the position of the new vertex to be the average of the endpoints
    of the current edge. After I have my new elements, I update the connectivity of all existing halfedges, vertices, faces, and edges to point to 
    the right elements.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    To implement loop subdivision, I followed the suggested steps in the starter code. First, I computed all new positions for each existing vertex 
    in the input mesh. For each vertex, I looped through all its neighbors, and updated the newPosition element with the value (1 - n * u) * original_position 
    + u * original_neighbor_position_sum. Additionally, I set the value of isNew for each vertex to false. Next, I iterated through all the existing 
    edges, and calculated the value of the new vertex which would be added to that edge as the value (3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)). I stored this value 
    in each edge's newPosition element. As I looped through, I also created a vector of all the original edges. I was then able to loop through the original 
    edges, calling splitEdge on each of them. I went through each created edge from splitEdge, and ensured that the right value for isNew was stored for all 
    of them. Now that I have created all the new edges, I can loop through all edges in the mesh. If the edge is new, and it connected one old vertex and one 
    new vertex, I call edgeflip on that edge. Finally, I do a final loop through the vertices and copy the new vertex positions into the final vertex position, 
    actually altering the coordinates of the mesh.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
  Before loop subdivision, sharp edges are very defined into the mesh shape. This is especially visible with the example shown below. As we subdivide into smaller 
  triangles, sharp edges become more and more rounded out because of the way in which we update the position of each vertex. Pre-splitting the vertices further distorts
  the original mesh, and adds more variation instead of keeping the sharp edge.

  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    The reason for the cube being slightly asymmetric is not all vercies had the same number of neighbors. Therefore, even though the cube started out completely symmetric, as we updated 
    vertex position based on the neighboring values. To fix this issue, I split each of the 6 edges that divided a face of the cube in half. Doing so ensured that each edge has 6 neighbors
    (instead of half having 3 neighbors, and the other have having six). Consequently, each edge would have the same mirrored updates on each subdivision. This correction is shown below:

<b>
    If you have implemented any extra credit extensions, explain what you did and document how they work with screenshots.
</b>
<p>
    I have implemented a boundary check for my mesh, ensuring that they are properly flipped and subdivided. We do not want to 
    flip a boundary edge, so that function does not change. For splitting an edge, we must only split the face that is not a 
    boundary. In the splitEdge function, I make sure to get the halfedges/verticies that exist within the mesh and perform split 
    only on that face. Next, I calculate the values for the old and new vertex positions differently in the upsample function 
    depending on if the element is on the boundary. If an old vertex is on the boundary, I do not want to loop through all the 
    neighboring vertices. Instead, I take the current vertex, v, the next vertex, v1, and compute their midpoint. I then store 
    the updated newPosition according to the formula (1.0 / 8.0) * (v->position + v1->position) + (3.0 / 4.0) * v->position. 
    Similarly, for the new vertices, while I am looping through the edges, I do a checkif the edge is on the boundary. If it is, 
    I store its new position as (1.0 / 2.0) * (v->position + v1->position). I proceed with the rest of my upsample/edgeSplit code 
    as is!
